3. Different sections tailored to diff. audiences
4. Doc should make sense to us first.


## Prerequisite Knowledge

### What you need to know before you read this document

TBD

Introduction to the basics. Headings in the previous document are as follows:









### Semantic Web vs World Wide Web

World Wide Web:

- Definition: “The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.”
- Library Context: Web sites, library catalogues, licensed databases
- Example:

Semantic Web:

- Definition:
- Library Context: “Microdata” behind web pages for semantic-aware processors to use. Large data sets for querying by programmers or bulk download.
- Example:

The big difference between these:




### RDF vs Semantic Web vs Linked Data

RDF:

- Definition:
- Library Context:
- Example:

Semantic Web:

- See above

Linked Data:

Definition: (cite the Tim Berners-Lee definition doc, which shows not only RDF is LD: https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html)
- Library Context:
- Example:


The big difference between these:



### Basic Data Modelling & ERM

Preamble: Open world of Linked Data vs previous ‘closed worlds’ of data

Basic Data Modelling:

- Definition:
- Library Context:
- Example:


ERM:

- Definition:
- Library Context:
- Example:

The big difference between these:



### Schema vs Serialization vs Encoding

Where to park MARC, MODS, RDA….?

Schema:

- Definition: “metadata standards intended to establish a common understanding of the meaning of data structures and values.”
- Library Context: RDA, BIBFRAME
- Example:

Serialization:

- Definition: “the process of translating data structures into a! format that can be stored or Transmitted.”
- Library Context:
- Example:

Encoding:

- Definition: “the process by which characters are converted into! byte sequences that can be! stored or transmitted.”
- Library Context: MARC, MODS
- Example:

The big difference between these:

### Ontology vs Thesaurus vs Controlled Vocabulary

Ontology:

- Definition: “a formal naming and definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities that really or fundamentally exist for a particular domain of discourse”
- Library Context:
- Example:

Thesaurus:

- Definition:
- Library Context:
- Example:

Controlled Vocabulary:

- Definition:
- Library Context:
- Example:

The big difference between these:





Could these be used and reworked as subheadings in this section?
